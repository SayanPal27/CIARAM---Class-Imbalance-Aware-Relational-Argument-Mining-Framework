    #Example 2:
    Input sentence :  [ there are opposing ideas of neglecting one 's cultural values to adapt in the new cultures ][][ they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values ]
    Target sentence :  [ there are opposing ideas of neglecting one 's cultural values to adapt in the new cultures ][Attack][ they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values ]

    #Example 3:
    Input sentence :  [ without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition ][][ we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education ]
    Target sentence :  [ without the cooperation , there would be no victory of competition ][Support][ we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education ]
    
    #Example 4:
    Input sentence :  [ children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends ][][ keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important ]
    Target sentence :  [ children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends ][Support][ keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important ]
    
    #Example 5:

    Target sentence :  [ sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential ][Support][ they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values ]

    #Example 6:
    Input sentence :  [ high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around ][][ public transportation systems even have more important advantages ]
    Target sentence :  [ high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around ][Attack][ public transportation systems even have more important advantages ]

    #Example 7:
    Input sentence :  [ technology may have negative effects on children ][][ technology makes children even more creative ]
    Target sentence :  [ technology may have negative effects on children ][Attack][ technology makes children even more creative ]

    #Example 8:
    Input sentence :  [ it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life ][][ animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance ]
    Target sentence :  [ it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life ][Attack][ animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance ]

    #Example 9:
    Input sentence :  [ the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory ][][ competition makes the society more effective ]
    Target sentence :  [ the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory ][Support][ competition makes the society more effective ]
    
    #Example 10:
